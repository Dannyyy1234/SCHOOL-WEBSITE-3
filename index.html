<h3><kbd>The Playground</kbd></h3>
<h4> The playground has recently been rebuilt and upgraded with funding from the PTA. It has multiple slides and places where you can play during recess. There is a jungle gym, monkey bars, and some swings. Many students enjoy playing there, and even go there after school to play and have fun with their friends. We hope that if your child comes over to CRS, he/she enjoys our newly updated playground as well! (The picture is of the old playground.) </h4>

<h3><kbd>The Gymnasium/Stage</kbd></h3>
<h4> The gym/stage area is where we do PE, the Bobcat Fitness Club, and so much more! We use the stage for performances and assemblies, while the gym is mainly used for PE. CRS's gymnasium is massive, with 4 basketball hoops, a rock climbing wall, and all sorts of equipment in the storage room. The stage is also pretty big, and we have had many assemblies there, with the performers/presenters on the stage, while the students are sitting on the gym floor. </h4>

<h3><kbd>The Cafeteria</kbd></h3>
<h4> The cafeteria is where the students gather to eat lunch during school hours. They can also eat breakfast there, if they arrive early enough. There is a specified lunch menu for every day. Cookie Day is normally Thursday, while Pizza Day is always Friday. There are a variety of meals, and drinks are provided. (Choices of milk (plain, chocolate, or strawberry (occasionally)) or water. (8 or 16 oz. bottles)) You can also pack your own lunch and bring it to school in a lunch box. </h4>

<h4> Churchill Road provides 4 levels of this program. Level 1 (Critical and Creative Thinking Lessons) is provided to students grades K-6, and consists of model lessons that are designed to teach critical and creative thinking skills. The lessons are modeled in all classrooms by Advanced Academic Resource Teachers (AARTs) and the thinking strategies are then used throughout the year by classroom and other teachers who work with students. Student responses to these lessons are used as part of the identification process for Levels II-IV. Parents may also practice these strategies during family conversations and activities. In Level 2 (Differentiated Lessons in Areas of Academic Strength, Grades ), the AART collaborates with classroom teachers to provide additional challenges through lessons and resources that extend and enrich the Program of Studies. Screening for this level of service is ongoing throughout the school year. For Level 3 (Part-Time Advanced Academic Programs), students identified by our local Advanced Academic committee work directly with the AART each week in a small group setting. During this time, students are challenged with enrichment and extension activities developed to enhance grade-level curriculum. Finally, for Level 4 (Full-Time Advanced Academic Programs), Students found eligible for placement in full-time Level IV Advanced Academic Programs through a central selection process receive a highly challenging instructional program in the four core subject areas. Churchill Road houses an AAP that draws identified gifted students from a number of neighboring elementary schools including Kent Gardens and Spring Hill . Currently there are multiple classrooms at each grade level from grades 3 through 6. Students in the AAP center study the same Fairfax County Program of Studies curriculum as do students in the base school with instructional techniques that are designed to match the educational learning styles of gifted students. All AAP students are instructed one year ahead in math and are engaged in a Mathematics contest called "Continental Math." Additional language arts, science and history units for gifted students, designed by the College of William and Mary's Center for Gifted Education, are part of the enriched AAP curriculum. Higher level thinking skills are stressed through class discussions and project-based learning, which allow students to learn to work together to solve problems. Technology is used as a tool for learning with all students. Students use computers for word processing, creating graphs, spreadsheets, and databases, designing multimedia presentations, and to access the Internet for research. </h4>

<h4> The Foreign Language in the Elementary School/Language through Content (FLES/LTC) Program helps students learn a world language through Science and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts, and Mathematics) integrated content. The program provides language learning opportunities to all students in an elementary school from grades K through 6th. The goal of FLES/LTC is to develop studentsâ€™ language proficiency and 21st-century skills by teaching World Languages through STEAM, with a strong emphasis on Science. Teachers use Project-Based Learning to help students learn another language while developing skills in all areas. Generally, students receive 60 minutes of language instruction per week. This model supports the five goal areas of the national standards for world language (communication, culture, connections, comparisons, and communities) and is aligned with the Virginia SOL for World Languages. </h4>

<h4> Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) provides a comprehensive, sequential Family Life Education (FLE) program for students in  kindergarten through grade twelve.  Instruction is seen as a partnership among parents and guardians, the school, and the community in supporting the learning essential to the development of strong families, positive relationships, and a healthy community. Parents/guardians may choose to opt out their child of all or part of the Family Life Education program.  Students who are opted out are provided with age-appropriate, nonpunitive, alternative health instruction, and every effort is made to foster respect for family choices.  If you wish to opt out your child  of all or part of FLE, please fill in the opt-out form and return it to the school prior to Family Life Education instruction. FLE grade level-specific lessons and media that FCPS has streaming rights for are available for parents online in FCPS 24-7 (Blackboard) Parent View.  Account information is available at your local school or online. Grade level-specific lessons are also available at the Fairfax County Regional Library in the City of Fairfax (this location does not have media).  Grade level-specific lessons and media that are not streamed online are available for review at your childâ€™s school library.  Due to copyright permissions, we are unable to stream all media online. Program questions may be addressed to Assistant Principal Ms. Niccolls, jniccolls@fcps.edu, by contacting FCPS Instructional Services at 571-423-4550, or by contacting Elizabeth Payne, FCPS Health and Physical Education Coordinator at etpayne@fcps.edu. </h4>

<h4> After weeks of hard work, excitement, and anticipation, our newest masterpiece is finally done! Our new playground! It has many additions to the old one, with a colorful playground set, a new set of monkey bars, an infinity loop, a new jungle gym, and so much more! A reminder that students will need to social distance at 6 feet apart while using the playground equipment, due to the exercise that they are putting in. We hope that you enjoy the playground a lot, and we can't wait to see our students play in our newly upgraded, updated playground! On the morning announcements, Mr. Varhol (or Mr. V) shared some tips for playing safely on the new playground, and we suggest that you follow those great tips that he came up with. Our playground is plenty big enough for all of the students on it to social distance, so that is what they should be doing for the WHOLE TIME, always while playing on the equipment and at recess. All of us at Churchill hope that your child has a wonderful time using and playing on our new playground, and we hope to see you soon! </h4>

<h4> A hearty congratulations to Mr. CK, as he is usually called, for his nomination of the Outstanding School-based Professional Employee Award for Region 1! As is written, 'Jordan has worked at Churchill Road Elementary School for 13 years. His first four years were spent teaching Physical Education, where he enjoyed teaching students healthy behaviors and movement skills. During this time, he also served as the Patrol Sponsor overseeing a team of 140 fifth and sixth-grade students who all worked to make the school a safe and inviting place to learn. For the last nine years, Jordan has served as a School-Based Technology Specialist and has overseen a schoolwide 1:1 student to laptop program so that teachers and students can operate in an environment rich with technology. Jordan is also currently serving as the Student Council Association Sponsor, assisting the officers leading the student-body government for the past four years.' Thank you, Mr. CK, for all that you have done for us! We appreciate you so much! </h4>
